# LawyerWordMacros
Microsoft Word macros useful to appellate lawyers.

Better instructions for use are forthcoming, but basically:

<ul>
<li>Tools / Macro / Visual Basic Editor</li>
<li>Normal / Modules / NewMacros</li>
<li>Paste the macro (from "Sub" to "End Sub", inclusive) at the bottom of the code box.</li></ul>


To trigger a macro:
<ul><li>Tools / Macros / Macro</li>
<li>Run</li></ul>

Or, better, 

Tools / Customize Keyboard

and assign a key combination (I like cmd-opt and shift-cmd-opt) to a macro.


For example, I've assigned "shift-cmd-opt-v" to the pasteWestlaw macro, which takes the text in the keyboard (presumably a quote copied with its citation from Westlaw) and pastes it at the cursor, cleaned up and in quotation marks.
